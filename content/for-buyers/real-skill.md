RealSkill is a platform to verify real programming skills. You can pick one of our mini projects and assign it to somebody. They need to check out the code from our git repository, add new functionality, or fix a bug, commit the changes and push the code back to our repository. Our system will pick up the changes and verify the correctness of the solution.
