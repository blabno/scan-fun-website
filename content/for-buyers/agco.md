Our developers helped develop large system for the global agricultural machine producer. The system collects and analyze telemetry data from farming vehicles from around the world, in realtime, in order to help visualise the usage, detect malfunctions or trigger customer or dealer configured alerts.

The system runs in the cloud as a large set of well orchestrated microservices.
